## Welcome to My Homepage
### Joonsang Lee, Ph.D.
I am a research engineer in the Department of Radiation Physics at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center.
I received his Ph.D. in the Physics and Astronomy department at the University of Georgia. My Ph.D. research focused primarily on development of a pharmacokinetic modeling in dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) and the development of image-processing algorithms for tumor segmentation. My research as a postdoctoral follow in Bioinformatics & Computational Biology at the MD Anderson Cancer Center has focused primarily on image processing on brain tumor images with various statistical techniques and machine learning. During this postdoctoral training, my projects ranged from texture analysis for the parametric map of DSC-MRI to the analysis of tumor heterogeneity in multiparametric MRI data.

My current research is on decoding tumor phenotype with Radiomics approach such as the extraction and analysis of advanced quantitative imaging features obtained from CT, PET or MRI. I am currently funded by the Center for Radiation Oncology (CROR) to provide radiomics research support to researchers throughout the institution.
