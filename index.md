### Joonsang Lee, Ph.D. 
<button name="button"><a href="https://aznets.github.io/jsleexxxxx/"> CV </a> <br>

I am a research specialist in the Department of Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics at the University of Michigan.
I received my Ph.D. in the Physics and Astronomy department at the University of Georgia. My Ph.D. research focused primarily on development of a pharmacokinetic modeling in dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) and the development of image-processing algorithms for tumor segmentation. My research as a postdoctoral follow in Bioinformatics & Computational Biology at the MD Anderson Cancer Center has focused primarily on image processing on brain tumor images with various statistical techniques and machine learning. During this postdoctoral training, my projects ranged from texture analysis for the parametric map of DSC-MRI to the analysis of tumor heterogeneity in multiparametric MRI data.
